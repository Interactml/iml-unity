InteractML is an Unity3d Plugin that enables developers to configure, train, and use Interactive Machine Learning (IML) systems within the game editor. Using visual scripting developers, designers and artists can visualise incoming data, configure game inputs (e.g., specifying what data to extract from sensors or objects in the game); train and refine ML models (by iteratively adding new training examples in realtime); and connect the ML model outputs (the real-time predictions calculated based on the training data) to other objects/scripts in the game scene. In addition, since InteractML doesn't rely on external software, the ML models can be trained and/or refined by player-provided examples in the final version of the game.

### Key features
* Lightweight machine learning models: Classification, Regression and Dynamic Time Warping
* Node visual scripting interface
* You can code your own nodes to satisfy needs not currenly covered
* Integration with any script to pipe data in/out
* Supported from Unity 5.3 and up
* Windows/Mac full support 

### Limitations
* Alpha stage

### Installation
Download the master branch and open with Unity. The unitypackages released are heavily outdated and buggy!

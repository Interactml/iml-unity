InteractML is an Unity3d Plugin that enables developers to configure, train, and use Interactive Machine Learning (IML) systems within the game editor. Using visual scripting developers, designers and artists can visualise incoming data, configure game inputs (e.g., specifying what data to extract from sensors or objects in the game); train and refine ML models (by iteratively adding new training examples in realtime); and connect the ML model outputs (the real-time predictions calculated based on the training data) to other objects/scripts in the game scene. In addition, since InteractML doesn't rely on external software, the ML models can be trained and/or refined by player-provided examples in the final version of the game.

### Key features
* Lightweight machine learning models: Classification, Regression and Dynamic Time Warping
* Node visual scripting interface
* You can code your own nodes to satisfy needs not currenly covered
* Integration with any script to pipe data in/out
* Supported from Unity 5.3 and up
* Windows/Mac full support 

### Limitations
* Alpha stage
* Anything not Windows/Mac not tested or currently supported

### Installation
Don't download the master branch! It currently contains several dependencies that might break your project. Instead, download one of the relase packages as follows:

1) Download the latest UnityPackage from the InteractML release github page here: [https://github.com/Interactml/iml-unity/releases](https://github.com/Interactml/iml-unity/releases)

2) With your unity project open, navigate to the top menu bar and select _Assets_. In the Assets menu select _Import Package_, then select _Custom Package_.

3) Find the downloaded unity package in your file system and click _Open_. Wait for unity to prepare the package.

4) In the Import Unity Package window that pops up click _Import_. Wait for unity to import the package.

Thatâ€™s it! The InteractML folder will appear in your assets folder along with a folder of examples to start you off.

### Dependencies
InteractML is built with 
* [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) - xNode is visual node framework that lets you view and edit node graphs inside Unity.
* [JsonNetForUnity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/json-net-for-unity-11347) - brings the power of Json and Bson serialization to Unity with support for 4.7.2 and up and is compatible with both .NET and IL2CPP backends.

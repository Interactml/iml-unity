 * Follow the initial [Getting Started](/Assets/VRTK/Documentation/GETTING_STARTED.md) steps and then add the `OVRCameraRig` prefab from [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) as a child of the SDK Setup GameObject.
 * On the `OVRCameraRig` in the scene find the `OVRManager` and set its `Tracking Origin Type` to `Floor Level`.

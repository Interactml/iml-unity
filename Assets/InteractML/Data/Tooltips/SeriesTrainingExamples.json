This node records a series of inputs for every inputs / output pairing.  This is used with only with DTW Machine Learning Model.  Live In port connects to one or more feature extractors or data types for recording the pose you are recording.

Recorded Data Out port connects to the Recorded Data In port on the Machine Learning Model node. Start recording starts to records the series of inputs taking a new input value every frame and when pressed again it pairs this with the current output value. The current input and target value are displayed in the centre of the node.",

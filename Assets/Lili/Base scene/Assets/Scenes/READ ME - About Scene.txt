We advice to use deferred rendering with linear color space setup.
- Linear color space: because all materials were setup to linear color rendering, at gamma they could be to intensive or simply render unproperly.
- Deferred rendering: it's because reflection probes have  blending distance setup, so whole surface will reflect environment properly.
You could use forward rendering but probably reflection probes should be adjusted by additional "box size" range. 
Anyway best performance at this project you will get with deffered rendering and linear color space.

If you will import full versions of the packs (from asset store) which we use to build this scene, they should automatically replace correct
files and give full resolution HQ view.
